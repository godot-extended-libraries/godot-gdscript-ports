# C++ to GDScript ports

The purpose of this repository is to translate built-in engine C++ classes back 
into pure GDScript, if possible.

List of ported classes:
- `RemoteTrasform2D`

Based on these classes you can:
- adapt them to your own needs via script;
- develop plugins inspired by Godot's built-in functionallity;
- if you feel like reimplemeting the existing functionallity via script would
promote faster prototyping of a major feature to be integrated back to C++.
